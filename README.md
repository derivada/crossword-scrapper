# Crossword Scrapper

This is a fun project with the goal of extracting crossword data such as blank pattern distribution, clue analysis, average size of words, dictionary ranking of words, etc. from the nice collection of crosswords at [**El Pa√≠s**](https://elpais.com/juegos/crucigramas).

The goal is to learn how web scraping works, along with doing some nice data analysis and getting some insights on crossword creation.

## How to use
1. Download mozilla firefox and setup a custom scraper profile at *profile:addons*
2. Install UBlockOrigin in this profile, to skip unnecesary video ads and make the process faster and more robust
3. Download Gecko Driver executable and place it on the project folder (with name `geckodriver.exe`)
4. Setup the .env variables for the firefox installation, the firefox profile and the gecko driver executable
5. Tweak additional configuration, explained at `settings.py`
6. Preferably, use a VPN just in case your IP gets banned (altough this small number of requests shouldn't be deemed harmful by the server)
7. Enjoy!
